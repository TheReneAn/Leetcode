 * 🔷 LeetCode 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower
 *
 * 🟢 Difficulty: Easy
 *
 * 📘 Problem:
 *   We are playing the Guess Game. I pick a number from 1 to `n`.
 *   You have to guess which number I picked.
 *
 *   Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number 
 *   I picked is higher or lower than your guess.
 *
 *   You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns:
 *     - -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked.
 *     -  1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked.
 *     -  0: Your guess is equal to the number I picked.
 *
 *   Return the number that I picked.
 *
 * 📥 Example 1:
 *   Input:  n = 10, pick = 6
 *   Output: 6
 *
 * 📥 Example 2:
 *   Input:  n = 1, pick = 1
 *   Output: 1
 *
 * 📥 Example 3:
 *   Input:  n = 2, pick = 1
 *   Output: 1
 *
 * ✅ Constraints:
 *   - 1 <= n <= 2³¹ - 1
 *   - 1 <= pick <= n
 *
 * 🚩 Topics:
 *   Binary Search, Interactive
