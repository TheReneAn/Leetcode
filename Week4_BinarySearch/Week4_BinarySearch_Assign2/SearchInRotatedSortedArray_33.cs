/***************************************************************
 * 🔷 LeetCode 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
 *
 * 🟡 Difficulty: Medium
 *
 * 📘 Problem:
 *   You are given a sorted array `nums` (ascending order, unique values),
 *   but it may have been rotated at an unknown pivot.
 *
 *   Your task is to find the index of a given `target` value.
 *   If the target is not found, return -1.
 *
 *   You must implement the search with O(log n) time complexity.
 *
 * 📌 Rotation Example:
 *   Original: [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]
 *   Rotated : [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]  ← rotated at index 3
 *
 * 📥 Example 1:
 *   Input:  nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
 *   Output: 4
 *
 * 📥 Example 2:
 *   Input:  nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
 *   Output: -1
 *
 * 📥 Example 3:
 *   Input:  nums = [1], target = 0
 *   Output: -1
 *
 * ✅ Constraints:
 *   - 1 <= nums.length <= 5000
 *   - -10⁴ <= nums[i], target <= 10⁴
 *   - All elements are unique
 *   - nums is sorted in ascending order and possibly rotated
 *
 * 🚩 Topics:
 *   Array, Binary Search
